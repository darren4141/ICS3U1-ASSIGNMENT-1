# ICS3U1-ASSIGNMENT-1

This program was written for Grade 11 computer science

It includes a base solve, (Assignment1) where what we could use was limited

The extension includes methods, arrays, and try/catch

There is also an applet extension

Program: Bubble tea program

Task: input the user's choice of bubble tea, how many they would like, how much they would like to tip, etc

2000+ lines of code across 3 files

## Additional Features:
- Full try catch bulletproofing (incorrect unput type, exceptional values)
- Arrays
- Methods
- HST and tip calculations
- Done in applets
- Additional messages after user orders different things on the menu
- Refund mode

### What I lost marks for (exact comments from teacher):
Final mark: 89/95

>#### Base Solve
>Internal documentation - looks good except for no P to IPO in internal documentation
>
>Doesn’t display a receipt- only shows final total
>
>Display $2.45 for currency on options - not +2.45
>
>Final invoice needs to show breakdown of all costs
>
>Not just final total for each
>
>Should be able to order another time and reset the values
>
>Don't ask for name again before asking for next order - menu then name or don’t repeat question


>#### Extension
>
>Try catch used
>
>No P in IPO again
>
>Receipt still needs work - look at display and fix it
>
>Does not repeat - this is an important aspect to our program - always loop them
>
>No sales analysis - lots of possible depth missing by not doing this extension - think about this for higher mark results
>
>Excellent work on applet


>Extensions included look good
